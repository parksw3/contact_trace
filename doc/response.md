Dear Hans:

Thank you for your thoughtful handling of the Park et al. MS RSPB-2019-1499.

We really appreciate your invitation to resubmit, but due to time constraints have decided to follow your advice and try JRSI instead for this theoretical component.

Should we do this as a fresh submission, or is there some channel I'm not aware of that would allow us to build on the existing reviews and editorial judgment?

Your help is appreciated.

Jonathan
