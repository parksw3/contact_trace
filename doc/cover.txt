To whom it may concern:

We are submitting our manuscript, “Inferring generation-interval distributions from contact-tracing data”, for consideration for publication in Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences. 

The reproductive number (i.e., the average number of secondary cases caused by a primary case) is a crucial quantity in models of disease spread. However, directly measuring the reproductive number requires detailed knowledge of disease history and is often difficult. Especially in an outbreak context, the reproductive number is often estimated from the exponential growth rate of an epidemic using generation-interval distributions.

A generation interval is a time between when an individual is infected and when that individual infects another person. The generation interval defines the time scale of an epidemic and, therefore, provides a link between epidemic speed (growth rate) and strength (reproductive number). This link has been widely utilized in outbreak analyses because generation intervals and exponential growth rates are easy to measure. In particular, generation intervals can be measured through contact tracing, by identifying who infected whom.

Our study asks how generation intervals, measured through contact tracing, vary temporally and spatially. Several studies have already characterized the difference between the forward measurement (looking at infectees) and the backward measurement (looking at infectors) of generation intervals over time, but have considered only homogeneously mixing populations, neglecting spatial and/or network structure. We study the effects of network interactions on observed generation intervals, and show that observed intervals contain information about the underlying population structure. We develop theory and use individual-based simulations to show that accounting for temporal bias arising from contact tracing provides a spatially informed generation-interval distribution, which correctly links the speed and strength of an epidemic.

Our study contributes to the field by providing both an intuitive understanding of how spatial and temporal effects interact in shaping observed generation intervals, and statistical methods for finding the ``effective'' generation interval that links epidemic strength to speed of spread. Our method of using implicit spatial information may be particularly valuable during epidemic outbreaks, because directly estimating contact structures is often difficult in this context. The ideas and perspectives in this article will help disease modelers and policy-makers navigate difficult questions around predicting and controlling infectious diseases.
