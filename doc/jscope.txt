Thank you for giving us opportunity to revise our manuscript rsif-2019-0719,entitled “Inferring generation-interval distributions from contact-tracing data”. Referee 1 provided a 12-page review, with ambitious suggestions, including a suggestion to make our paper into two papers: one theoretical and one statistical. While we appreciate the reviewer's valuable comments, we believe that there is an urgent need to lay out the practical issues we address here. We would therefore prefer to leave the paper largely in the current form, with a bias towards the practical, hopefully returning to a more theoretical treatment later. While we would address most of the reviewer's comments directly, we would also postpone dealing with some suggestions (not omitting to mention the associated issues). We hope that plan is acceptable to you.

Given the extensive suggestions of this referee, we would like to request a resubmission date of 15 April for the revision. 

We look forward to hearing back from you.

Sincerely,

Sang Woo Park
